Position property (Position:)

static;
	The default value, means it should follow the flow of the HTML file.

relative;
	moves the element relative to IT'S OWN ORIGINAL POSITION; so if you say:
left: 10px; this will move the element 10px to the right.

BUT it DOESN'T REMOVE IT from the flow, it's SPACE is still reserved for it, so nothing else moves at all BUT that element.

absolute;
	Removes the element COMPLETELY from it's original position, and positions it relative to THE LAST POSITIONED PARENT; if this is an element inside a div, it will position itself relatively to the whole html element, UNLESS you use a "position" value, changing it from it's original "static" state to something else - like "relative" - this way the element will be positioned relatively to it's parent, the div.

So a "relatively" positioned element can have "absolutely" positioned elements inside of it.

it's not strict to "relative", any position OTHER THAN STATIC works, but usually you'll use relative if you don't actually wanna change the element position, just it's children.

fixed;
	ALWAYS relative to the HTML element, AND STICKS to it's position if you scroll.

sticky;
	acts the same way as "relative" UNTIL it hits the border of the screen when you scroll, then it acts like "fixed"
